make game endless(going offscreen makes it change to a new grid layout)
make the game responsive(grid is redrawn based on screen size but still endless)
add enemies(things that move around the screen and have to be avoided or else you lose a life)
maybe even have hidden enemies that are only revealed once you reach a certain vicinity
add friends(things that are stationary on a green square and offer extra lives, points, map reveals, etc.)
make grid change color based whenever you go offscreen, to indicate a new grid
keep track of previous grid/game states so when you return to grid, it is same as you left it(2d array)
or instead of making the grid endless, have finite gameboard and hardcode states with dynamic updates, so grid states are preserved.
maybe add audio to indicate when nearing landmines, without giving away the exact location
