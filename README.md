# Minefield

A modern twist on the classic Minesweeper game. The objective of the game in Minesweeper is essentially to click around on the grid on random squares, which will either reveal a preset number of points from 1-3, an empty space which reveals all adjacent empty spaces, or a mine(bomb). If you reveal a bomb, the whole grid blows up and you lose. In Minefield, the player starts with a character in the upper left most square in the grid, and traverses the field using the arrow keys to move their character. The goal of the game is to complete the missions while avoiding the mines that are randomly hidden around; missions range from collecting objects around the grid to rescuing other characters from the mine laden field.
